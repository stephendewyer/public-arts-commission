        "bio": "Frances Cathryn is an editor, arts educator and community organizer who collaborates with others to shift how we define what it means to create valuable work in the world.  Over the years, she formed relationships with arts organizers and social-justice activists who struggle to do anti-oppression work in museums and traditional nonprofits, and learned how grassroots community-building can lead to change in institutions large and small.  She developed a social practice that focuses on institutional divestment and anti-oppression in the arts, and collaborates with community spaces, organizations, museums and others in the industry to build temporary gatherings where folks learn how to turn individual resources into collective action.  Through wip projects, Frances helps organizations dismantle systems of bias that exclude the voices of marginalized folks from the cultural conversation around art making.",
